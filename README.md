This repository is a part of an ongoing project that helps building Personal Credo using agile planning - occupational and personal.
Adapted from the 2022 book written by Dr. James Loehr 'Leading with Character'.

"You can have all the credentials in the world,
but if you don't believe in yourself, then you are just another person
with a lot of useless pieces of paper."
